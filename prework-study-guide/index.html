      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage
          that users cannot see, open this document in VS code to 
        see how the HTML talks to the browser, adds website title etc</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown
          to the user, use tags in the code to edit the text like
          you would in word, like adding headers, paragraph text,
          bulleted lists like this and pictures</li>
        <li>h1, h2 and so fourth add headers of different sizes,
          bolded for readers to differentiate, 'HTML' heading here is 
          an h2</li>
          <li> ul= unordered list, shows as bullet points, ol=
            ordered list, use li= list item, each bullet/number

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an
          element directly in the HTML file ex: h1 style="color:red;" >Prework Study Guide< close header
        </li>
        <li> Internal style sheets are embedded in the head of the HTML ex: 
          head 
          style h1 { color: red;}
          close style 
          close head 
          this states that all h1 elements on the page will be red
        </li>
        <li>External style sheets are linked in the head of the HTML (see link tag for 
          example, href defines where to look in directory for the style sheet) </li>
          <li>A margin is space around the outside element, while padding is space around the content
            inside an element
          </li>
